# kennel-1.0
Kennel is an Android application in which the pet lovers can host pets and the travelling pet owners can drop their pets by reserving 
a slot for them. The application focuses on reducing the price that the pet hotels charge and brings about an opportunity for pet lovers
to have pets over and enjoy the time around them. Since always good to have a side gig going, pet lovers can make some extra bucks do something that they love which is being around pets. The Kennel application uses Amazon web services to store and retrieve user data including the uploading/downloading images from the host as well as the customer.  

Concept Summary

A well-planned vacation that includes furry family members is fun for everyone, but not for your pet. It's tempting to want to bring your pet with you, but sometimes your pets aren't suited for travel due to temperament, illness or physical impairment and other times taking your pets along may seem as a very expensive option.
Most pet owners prefer to leave their pets in a pet hotel that easily charges over 50$ per night. Leaving pets at home cost pet parents an extra $486 per trip (for 5 days) due to pet care and accommodations. Most pet owners say they rely on friends or family to watch their pets.
With the Kennel app people get the best of both worlds. In this app all pet lovers can register themselves as hosts, and people who are travelling (User) can make reservations to board their pets with these hosts.
